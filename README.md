```bash
git clone https://github.com/sergiovzambelli/photography-website.git
cd photography-website

### 2. Install dependencies

Make sure you have `Node.js` installed. Then, install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

or if you're using Yarn:

```bash
yarn install
```

### 3. Run the development server

To start the development server, run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

or with Yarn:

- **Colors**: Tailwind CSS utility classes are used for styling. You can adjust colors and styling by modifying Tailwindâ€™s configuration file or adding custom classes.
